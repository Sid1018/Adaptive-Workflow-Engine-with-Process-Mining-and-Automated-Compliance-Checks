This project aims to create an intelligent and adaptive workflow engine leveraging advanced technologies in machine learning and process mining.
Here is a professional README file for the project:
The system includes the following key components:

1. **Adaptive Workflow Engine**: Creates a dynamic workflow engine that adapts to changing processes and requirements using machine learning to predict workflow bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.
2. **Process Mining for Optimization**: Uses process mining to analyze and visualize current workflows, identifying inefficiencies and recommending improvements based on real data.
3. **Automated Compliance Checks**: Integrates automated compliance verification into workflows to ensure that all tasks and approvals meet regulatory requirements, reducing human error.

## Overview
The Adaptive Workflow Engine with Process Mining and Automated Compliance Checks project is designed to enhance the efficiency, adaptability, and compliance of workflow management systems. By integrating machine learning, process mining, and automated compliance checks, this system provides a robust solution for modern workflow management needs, particularly in complex and dynamic environments.

## Features
### Adaptive Workflow Engine
- Uses a decision tree classifier to predict the next activity in a workflow and suggest optimizations based on real-time data.
- Adapts to changing processes and requirements, ensuring that workflows remain efficient and effective.

### Process Mining for Optimization
- Analyzes and visualizes current workflows using the `pm4py` library.
- Identifies inefficiencies and bottlenecks, providing data-driven recommendations for process improvements.

### Automated Compliance Checks
- Ensures that all tasks and approvals meet predefined regulatory requirements.
- Reduces human error by automatically verifying compliance at each step of the workflow.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab account
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `pm4py`, `scikit-learn`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sid1018/adaptive-workflow-engine.git
   cd adaptive-workflow-engine
   ```

2. Open each notebook in Google Colab:
   - `Adaptive_Workflow_Engine.ipynb`
   - `Process_Mining.ipynb`
   - `Automated_Compliance_Checks.ipynb`

3. Install the required libraries within each notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install pandas numpy networkx pm4py scikit-learn
   ```

4. Run each cell in the notebooks to execute the code.

## Usage
